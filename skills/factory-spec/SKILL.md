description: Use when a factory item is at stage spec - writes the item's spec from the product brain without human back-and-forth
---

Below, `factory` means `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/factory/factory.py" --repo .`. Item paths like `items/<id>/...` live under `.factory/` — the full path is `.factory/items/<id>/...`.

## Contract

- **Entry stage:** `spec`.
- **Artifacts produced:** `items/<id>/spec.md`.
- **Exit:** for `kind: ui` or `kind: mixed`, attempt `factory advance ITEM design`; for `kind: backend`, attempt `factory advance ITEM plan`. The engine gate is the authority on what's legal — if it refuses, report the gate message verbatim rather than guessing a different stage.

## Read first

Read the item body, `items/<id>/triage.md`, and the brain surfaces: `docs/factory/brain/vision.md`, `users.md`, `personas.md`, `constraints.md`, and (for `ui`/`mixed` items) `design-system.md`, plus `docs/factory/journeys/graph.json` and `inventory.md`.

## The autonomous substitute for brainstorming

There is no human in this loop to argue with, so the dialogue that normally happens in brainstorming has to happen against the brain instead:

1. **Enumerate the 3-5 key design questions** this item raises — the kind of thing a brainstorming partner would ask (scope boundary, key user flow, data shape, failure mode, what's explicitly out).
2. **Answer each question from the brain.** For every question, check vision.md, users.md, personas.md, constraints.md, and design-system.md for a real answer — including whether the choice serves the primary persona. An answer counts only if you can point to the source passage — don't infer one from vibes.
3. **Where the brain has no answer — a brain gap — choose the most reversible option.** Reversible means: cheapest to undo later, narrowest surface area, closest to what a user could reasonably expect. Never pick the option that's hardest to walk back just because it looks more complete.
4. **Record the assumption** in the spec under `## Assumptions (brain gaps)`, naming the question, the choice made, and why it's reversible.
5. **File a bid** for each brain gap via the `council-judgement` skill, targeting `--surface brain/open-questions.md`, so the gap becomes durable memory instead of getting silently re-decided by the next item that hits it:

   ```
   factory bid product TOPIC "CLAIM" --evidence .factory/items/<id>/spec.md --surface brain/open-questions.md --severity low
   ```

   Use the round-note/evidence rules from `council-judgement`: since there's no real citation for a gap, the item's own spec is the provenance pointer, not proof.

This loop — enumerate, answer-from-brain, reversible-default, record, file-bid — is mandatory for every question that the brain doesn't answer. Skipping the bid leaves the gap invisible to future items.

## Large items: dispatch spec-writer

If the spec would run to roughly more than a screen of `## Behavior` bullets, or `items/<id>/triage.md` flags the item as complex, don't author it inline — dispatch `agents/spec-writer.md` with the item body, `triage.md`, and the brain excerpts from Read first. It runs the same enumerate/answer-from-brain/reversible-default loop and returns the spec text as its final report; this session (the orchestrator, not the subagent) persists that report to `items/<id>/spec.md` — the same orchestrator-persists convention council rounds use. `agents/spec-writer.md` is read-only (Read, Grep, Glob), so it cannot file bids itself: after persisting the spec, file a `factory bid` per brain gap its report names, same as step 5 above. The subagent is read-only, so after persisting its spec text the orchestrator also performs duty 1's writes — registering any new journey the report names as an inventory-only entry and drafting a minimal contract for any journey it flags as lacking one — writes impact.json from the report's ## Journey impact section (duty 2), and runs the factory journeys verb (duty 3), exactly as it files the bids.

## Journey impact — map, declare, set (mandatory)

The engine refuses to leave spec until journey impact is recorded; these
three duties run for every item, in order:

1. **Map.** Read `docs/factory/journeys/graph.json` and `inventory.md`; map
   the item's `## Behavior` onto journey nodes. An item that introduces a
   new journey registers it directly as an inventory-only entry (next free
   `J-NNN` id, `status: inventory`, cited to this item's spec) — the same
   direct-write license triage has for `roadmap.md`. Any affected journey
   that has no contract yet gets a **minimal draft contract** at
   `docs/factory/journeys/contracts/J-NNN-<slug>.md` with `status: draft`
   recorded in `graph.json`: cover at least the touched nodes (what the
   customer knows at each, what they expect next), deterministic oracles
   for the required scenarios, a Run & fixtures section (exact launch
   commands, fixture setup, credentials through safe fixture mechanisms),
   interruption/recovery paths, and a default **polish battery** of AI
   judgement questions seeded on every touched node — density: "what on
   this screen is not needed for what the customer is doing at this
   node?"; craft: "what would a first-time customer visually notice as
   unfinished?"; consistency: "does this screen read as the same product
   as the previous node (type, color, spacing rhythm — against
   `design-system.md` where seeded)?"; trust: "would a first-time customer
   trust this screen with their data or money?". Contract authors may add more, never fewer —
   depth scaled by the tier's `assure` profile
   (`factory doctor --json` → tiers: bug `node`, feature
   `affected`, epic `full`). Amending a `status: approved` contract is
   NEVER done directly — that goes through a `council-judgement` bid with
   `--surface journeys/contracts/<file>`. When any `mcp__claude-design__*`
   tool is present and `designsync_project` is configured, regenerate the
   linked project's `factory-journeys.html` map after registering a
   journey or drafting a contract (capabilities skill's
   `references/designsync.md` `## Journeys`) — best-effort, never
   blocking, one proxy spend event.
2. **Declare.** Write the `## Journey impact` spec section (see structure
   below) AND its machine twin `.factory/items/<id>/assurance/impact.json`
   (shape: `schemas/assurance-impact.schema.json` — per journey: id,
   nodes_changed, transitions_changed, new_states, and the required
   scenarios, each `{id, kind: happy|recovery|interruption, description}`).
   The assure stage cross-checks verdicts against this file scenario by
   scenario. For a no-impact item the section reads exactly
   `None — no customer journey affected.` plus a one-line justification,
   and NO impact.json is written.
3. **Set.** Run `factory journeys ITEM <none|J-004,...>` — exactly how
   triage runs `factory tier`. The spec-exit gate checks both the section
   heading and this declaration.

## Spec structure

Write `items/<id>/spec.md` with these sections, in order:

- `## Purpose` — what this item is for and why it matters, one paragraph.
- `## Behavior` — what the system does, described concretely enough to build from.
- `## Journey impact` — affected journey ids (from `graph.json`), nodes
  changed, transitions changed, new states introduced, and required
  assurance scenarios (happy path, recovery paths, viewport requirements
  where the surface is a browser) — or exactly
  `None — no customer journey affected.` plus a one-line justification.
  If the item body contains a section titled
  `## Journey impact (seeded at bug intake — carry into spec.md verbatim)`,
  its content MUST appear verbatim here — it may be extended, never
  replaced or reworded.
- `## Non-goals` — what this item explicitly does not cover.
- `## Assumptions (brain gaps)` — one entry per brain gap from the loop above (omit the section only if there were none).
- `## Acceptance criteria` — a numbered list, each criterion testable (a later stage can check it mechanically or by inspection, not by opinion). If the item body contains a section titled `## Acceptance criteria (seeded at bug intake — carry into spec.md verbatim)`, its criteria MUST appear verbatim in this list — they may be joined by further criteria, never replaced or reworded.

## Exit

- `ui` or `mixed`: `factory advance ITEM design`.
- `backend`: `factory advance ITEM plan`.

If the gate refuses (missing spec content, wrong kind, wrong current stage), do not retry with a different stage guess — report the refusal message verbatim and stop.
